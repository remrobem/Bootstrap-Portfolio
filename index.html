                    <p>Rob Martin is an IT professional with 35 years of experience. Rob grew up as a developer in the IBM mainframe
                        world, moved on to being an SAP developer, fell into web application vulnerability scanning and has
                        plowed thru SAP security, governance, risk management and compliance.

                    <p>Not one to shy away from change, Rob is now pursing challenges in web application development. Front-end,
                        back-end, UI design, testing, anything is possible at this point.

                    <p>Please don't hold this against him, but Rob has spent most of his career in a Fortune 250 company. Twenty
                        six years of multi-million dollar projects, you're on your own projects, managing development and
                        support teams, coding, testing, fixing, you name it.

                    <br>
                    <p>Rob doesn't care much about moving up the management ladder, preferring to hone his creative and debugging

                    <p>Rob and his wife Teresa have been married for 36 years. They raised 3 great sons, have a wonderful daughter-in-law
                        and a fantastic grandson. And they have a cat they would rather not talk about.
